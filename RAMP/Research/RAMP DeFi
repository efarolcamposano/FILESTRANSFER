 Public key cryptography 
x----------------x
a cryptographic system which uses pairs of keys: Public key and private key.

public key  is use only for encrypting data and can only be decrypted by matching private key.  

the public key can be distributed without compromising security.


  BIP39 
        - Mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys.
        - These mnemonics are further used to recover accounts and related crypto balance.
        - Most common standard used for seed phrases
        - Seed Phrases - list of words which store all the information needed to recover Bitcoin funds on-chain

        Deterministic - means that keys are no longer created randomly, but instead generated as part of a linked chain. Regular backups are no longer required as 
        long as the private-key seed that created the chain is safe.

 Ethereum
x----------------x
It's a technology behind the cryptocurrency ether and it's a open-source platform for people to build decentralized applications.  

    Decentralized Applications (or DApps) are applications that do not rely on a centralized backend running in AWS or Azure. 

You can alse use Ethereum for:

1. Ethereum wallet - to access to your ethereum funds and application. Only you have access to your wallet.
2. Get StableCoin - you can buy, earn by working on ethereum projects or borrow using crypto collateral.
3. Stake Eth - to become etheruem validator and earn you new ETH in the process.

    As a validator youâ€™ll be responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. This will keep ethereum secure to everyone.

Tomo Chain + Pantograph extension
x------------------------------------------x
TomoChain is a scalable blockchain-powered via Proof-of-Stake Voting consensus and used commercially by companies globally.

You can also create Decentralized App in TomoChain, write your own contract, deploy your App and create UI to interact with smart contract.

    Consensus Mechanism - authenticating and validating a value or transaction on a Blockchain 
                        - a distributed ledger without the need to trust or rely on a central authority.

# Pantograph extension - A TomoChain wallet in your browser. It exist as an extension wallet which facilitate the TomoChain blockchain without setting up a full node on TomoChain.

 RAMP DeFi
x----------------x
What I understand about RAMP is, it allows you to leverage those assets without losing liquidity rewards.

Ex.
"If you stake on their RAMP DeFi node, you will be able to use those assets as a collateral to get some stablecoin (rUSD) in return. So, You can use that on the 
ethereum blockchain to buy whatever you want without losing your liquidity rewards."
